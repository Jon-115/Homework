wE WEAR THE MASK THAT GRINS AND LIES,
iT HIDES OUR CHEEKS AND SHADES OUR EYES,â€”
tHIS DEBT WE PAY TO HUMAN GUILE;
wITH TORN AND BLEEDING HEARTS WE SMILE,
aND MOUTH WITH MYRIAD SUBTLETIES.

wHY SHOULD THE WORLD BE OVER-WISE,
iN COUNTING ALL OUR TEARS AND SIGHS?
nAY, LET THEM ONLY SEE US, WHILE
       wE WEAR THE MASK.

wE SMILE, BUT, o GREAT cHRIST, OUR CRIES
tO THEE FROM TORTURED SOULS ARISE.
wE SING, BUT OH THE CLAY IS VILE
bENEATH OUR FEET, AND LONG THE MILE;
bUT LET THE WORLD DREAM OTHERWISE,
       wE WEAR THE MASK!
