        <p>Hi my name is <b>Jonathan Batalla</b>.</p>
        <p>One of the nicest places I enjoy visiting since I was a kid is the <a href="https://www.houstonzoo.org">Houston Zoo</a>, here in Houston, Texas.  </p>
        <p>It has expanded over the years and now contains more than 4,500 animals and 800+ speices. I enjoy </p> 
        <p>seeing all the different species of animals and how they behave. Although some are more animated than</p>
        <p>others, it doesn't take the fun away from the ability to see them up close(at least as close as you</p>
        <p>would want to get infront of a massive creature that could tear you from limb to limb.)</p>
        <p>Some of my personal favorite animals I enjoy seeing everytime I visted are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lions</li>
            <li>Tigers</li>
            <li>Jaguars</li>
            <li>and the Komodo Dragon</li>
        </ul>
